    "## 1. Structured vs Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be found in two ways, as **structured** and **unstructured**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured data** is the one we find \"neatly\" organized in databases as rows and columns. Data in databases are organized in a two-dimensional, tabular format (think of it as the data you see on a grid or matrix-like spreadsheet) where every data point, unit of measure or observation can be found in the rows, and where the characteristics (also called variables or features) of each one of these observations can be found in the columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Unstructured data**, on the other hand, is more difficult to acquire, format, and manipulate as it is not often found neatly organized in a database. Unstructured data is often heavily composed of an entangled combination of text, numbers, dates, and other formats of data that are found in the wild (e.g. documents, emails, pictures, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What is a Data Cleaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia has a beatiful definition of data cleaning, which was in turned been modified from a paper from Shaomin Wu titled, _\"A Review on Coarse Warranty Data and Analysis\"_ (see citation below).\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.\"_ ~ Wikipedia & Shaomin Wu\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first encounter messy data, we usually start by going through a non-exhaustive checklist and/or use some rules of thumbs to identify, tackle, and repeat, each mess from the messy pile of data we have. Some of the items in our checklist might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do we have column names? If so,\n",
    "- Are the column names normalised? (e.g. lower case, spaces or no spaces, numbers only as names)\n",
    "- Do we have dates? If so,\n",
    "    - how are these represented?\n",
    "    - Do we have different formats in different rows? (e.g. 31-Oct-2020, October 31st 2020, ...)\n",
    "    - Do they have the time in them or is this in a separate column?\n",
    "- Are there different data structures within an element of an observation? (e.g. do we have lists with lists in them inside the value of a row and column combinantion)\n",
    "- If we have numerical data points representing a monetary value, which denomination are these in?\n",
    "- How was the data generated?\n",
    "- Do we have any missing values? if so,\n",
    "    - Are they missing at random?\n",
    "    - Are they missing by accident? (e.g. was it due to an error during the data collection process)\n",
    "    - Are they intentionally empty? (e.g. think of a conditional question in a survey, if the participant answered yes to the previous question, use this one next, if not, skip 3 questions)\n",
    "- Are there any outliers in our dataset? if so,\n",
    "    - Are these true outliers? (e.g. finding the salary of Jeff Bezos in a list with the income of all of the people from the state of Washington)\n",
    "    - Are these mistakes? (e.g. finding negative prices for the price of bread)\n",
    "- Are there any duplicate observations/samples in our dataset?\n",
    "    \n",
    "All of this questions get tackled in a data format described by Hadley Wickham in a paper by the same name as the data format, called _\"Tidy Data\"_. In his paper, Hadley describes _Tidy Data_ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> _\"Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.\"_ ~ Hadley Wickham\n",
    "\n",
    "While our datasets might not contain all of the issues described in Tidy Data that might come un in messy datasets, the strategies and concepts outlined in it will prove useful in many cases you might encounter throughout your career so I highly recommend that you read it at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing about data cleaning, it is not a one time thing during the data analytics cycle but quite the opposite, you might find yourself going back to the data cleaning process 2 or more times as your understanding of the data increases during the same project.\n",
